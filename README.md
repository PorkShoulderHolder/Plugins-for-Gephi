#Plugins for Gephi


In this repository I list the plugins I created for Gephi. See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/) for the ready-to-use versions of these plugins.

##1. Alphabetical Sorter
This plugin is helpful to neatly sort and put apart isolated nodes floating around, before an export to SVG or PNG.  
See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/alphabetical-sorter/) for details.  


##2. Force Atlas 3D

Force Atlas 2 is a layout for Gephi created by Mathieu Jacomy et al., scalable to 10,000 nodes and more.  
Force Atlas *3D* extends it to 3 dimensions instead of 2.  
See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/force-atlas-3d/) for details.  

##3. Maps of Countries

Take a country, continent or the entire world map and display in with Gephi. Useful to serve as a background for geolocalized networks.
See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/maps-of-countries/) for details.  


##4. Excel / csv converter to network

Import an Excel spreadsheet or csv file into Gephi, while providing methods to create networks from these types of files.
See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/excel-csv-converter-to-network/) for details.

##5. Give color to your nodes

Reads a node attribute that contains RGB or #hex values, and colors nodes accordingly.
See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/give-color-to-nodes/) for details.
